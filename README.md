Duplicate Deletion
--
This is the technical assessment for the Adobe Software Engineer 2 role. This code reads in a structured 
JSON file given the filename as an argument to the program, and removes duplicates based on the following rules.

Rules:
 - ID must be unique
 - Email must be unique
 - Identical dates in the file result in the newer date being chosen
 - Newer data is preserved over older data.


Program execution is done as follows:

Execute:

python3 DuplicateDeleter.py <filename>

The filename is passed in as a parameter, indicating the file to process and remove duplicates from.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions! You can reach me, Kedar Abhyankar, at krabhyankar@gmail.com.
